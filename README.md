# Neverland Money - Landing Page

A Next.js 15.3 landing page with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and advanced AI chat integration. Features animated starfield backgrounds, responsive design, smooth scroll animations, and vector-powered knowledge base using OpenAI + Pinecone.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **pnpm** (package manager)
- **OpenAI** API key (for chat functionality)
- **Pinecone** API key (for vector search)
- **React 19** compatible dependencies
- **Windows users**: **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) recommended

### Install pnpm

If you don't have pnpm installed:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g pnpm

# Using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install pnpm

# Using Scoop (Windows)
scoop install pnpm

# Or using the installation script
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd neverland-landing-v2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and initialize Husky**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   The installation automatically initializes Husky via the `prepare` script in package.json.

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
   PINECONE_INDEX=your_pinecone_index_name_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm dev:hostname` - Start development server with specific hostname (0.0.0.0)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm clean` - Clean .next, storybook-static, coverage and node_modules directories, then reinstall dependencies
- `pnpm build-storybook` - Build Storybook for production
- `pnpm storybook` - Start Storybook component library

## Analytics

This project uses Vercel Analytics for tracking user interactions and engagement:

### Implemented Tracking Features

- **Page Tracking**: Automatic page view tracking via Vercel Analytics
- **User Interaction Tracking**:
  - Header navigation and social icon clicks
  - Footer navigation and social link clicks
  - Hero and Footer section CTA button interactions
  - Scroll to Top button interactions
  - Chat assistant interactions (open, minimize, close)
  - FAQ accordion expand/collapse actions
- **Section Time Tracking**: Measures how long users spend viewing each section of the page using the `SectionTracker` component

### Analytics Component

The `SectionTracker` component uses the Intersection Observer API (via `react-intersection-observer`) to monitor user engagement with different page sections. It sends periodic analytics events with section ID, name, and accumulated view duration.
